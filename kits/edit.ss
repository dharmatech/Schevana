;;; kits/edit.ss — text editing, pure: no window, no ui object, no screen.
;;;
;;; What a text field, a text area or an editor needs: an edit (the text,
;;; the caret and the selection, and where the text last changed), what
;;; the editing keys do to it, and the text's rows, wrapped at a width,
;;; computed only as far as they are asked for and remembered. Measuring
;;; is a procedure passed in, (lambda (str) width), so the tests need no
;;; font. The widget kit's text boxes are built on it, and so is Tasks'
;;; description editor; an Editor app would add undo, find and files on
;;; top.
;;;
;;;   (define e (edit-at "hello world" 5))

;;;   (edit-row-at lay 8)                              ; 1: "world"
;;;
;;; Indices are character indices; the selection is [min(caret, anchor),
